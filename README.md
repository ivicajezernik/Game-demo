# 1. Introduction
This is a simple platformer game demo I made for a job interview.
The player controls the red ball and needs to move it to the end of each level.

# 2. Installation
To play the game, you need to download the game_Data folder and game.exe file.
Launch the game.exe file to play. <br>
To open the project itself, you need to download the repository and have the Unity engine installed.
All assets, scenes and scripts are located in the Assets folder. <br>
Open the Unity Editor, press open, navigate to the project folder and press select folder.
You can download the Unity Editor [**here**](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download).
